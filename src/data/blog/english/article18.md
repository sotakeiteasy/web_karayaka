## Initial Costs When Purchasing

Buying property in Turkey involves not only paying for the property itself but also a number of mandatory expenses. The main tax is the title deed transfer tax, which amounts to 4% of the cadastral value of the property as determined by the government. Usually, this payment is split between the seller and the buyer, but in practice, most of the cost falls on the new owner.

Additionally, notary and translator services are paid for if the transaction involves a foreigner. The cost of these services varies by region but typically amounts to several hundred euros. Also included in the expenses is the power of attorney fee if registration is handled by a representative.

An important element is the payment for an independent property appraisal. Banks and government authorities require an official report confirming the market value of the property. This procedure ensures transaction transparency and protects the buyer’s interests.

## Annual Mandatory Payments

After registering ownership, the owner must consider regular expenses. The main one is the property tax. Its rate depends on the type of property and location:

- apartments and houses — from 0.1% to 0.2% of the cadastral value;
- commercial real estate — up to 0.4%;
- land plots — on average 0.3%.

Payment is made annually, usually in two installments — spring and autumn. Late payments result in fines and interest charges.

In addition to the tax, a mandatory fee for the maintenance of the residential complex (aidat) applies. Its amount is set by the management company and depends on the infrastructure: the more pools, fitness centers, and security, the higher the costs. On average, aidat ranges from 30 to 150 euros per month.

It is also important to consider property insurance. It is divided into mandatory — against earthquakes (DASK), and voluntary — against fires, floods, and other risks. Even a minimal policy guarantees compensation in case of emergencies.

## Additional Expenses and Investor Perspectives

Besides the main taxes, the owner must account for indirect expenses. These include utility bills, internet and TV connection fees, as well as repair costs. When renting out the property, income tax on rental earnings and reporting to tax authorities become mandatory.

For investors, it is important to understand that the tax and fee system in Turkey is quite transparent. Most payments are fixed, and their structure is predictable. This creates favorable conditions for long-term planning and allows for advance calculation of investment profitability.

Advantages of the Turkish system include:

- moderate rates compared to European countries;
- clear payment procedures and control through government services;
- the ability to optimize expenses by choosing the region and type of property.

Thus, purchasing property in Turkey requires a careful approach not only to selecting the object but also to studying the financial aspects of the transaction. Knowing the structure of taxes and mandatory fees helps avoid unnecessary expenses and forms a realistic understanding of ownership costs.
