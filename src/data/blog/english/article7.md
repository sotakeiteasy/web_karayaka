A Title Cancellation and Registration Lawsuit is a legal action filed to cancel unlawfully or improperly registered title deeds and to correct the land registry in favor of the rightful owner. These lawsuits are typically initiated by individuals who claim that the land registry does not reflect the actual ownership status. No changes can be made to the land registry until the court decision becomes final.

## Who Can File a Title Cancellation and Registration Lawsuit?

Anyone whose rights have been violated due to a land registry record, whose ownership rights have been infringed upon, or who claims to be the rightful owner can file this lawsuit. The case is filed against the person registered as the owner in the land registry or their legal heirs.

## Which Court Handles Title Cancellation and Registration Lawsuits?

These lawsuits must be filed in the civil court of first instance located in the jurisdiction where the property is situated. This court has exclusive jurisdiction, meaning the case cannot be heard in any other court.

## Reasons for Filing a Title Cancellation and Registration Lawsuit

- Legal Incapacity: When the person transferring the property does not have the legal capacity to do so (e.g., due to old age, mental illness, intoxication, etc.).
- Collusion to Deprive Heirs (Muris Muvazaası): Title transfers made to deprive rightful heirs of their inheritance.
- Abuse of Power of Attorney: When an agent misuses their authority to transfer property to themselves or others unlawfully.
- Zoning and Planning Irregularities: Title records altered unlawfully due to zoning laws or municipal planning.
- Family Residence Annotation (Aile Konutu Şerhi): When one spouse transfers the family residence without the other's consent.
- Adverse Possession and Occupation: Individuals who have continuously possessed and used the property like an owner for 20 years may request title registration.
- Transfer by Forged Power of Attorney: Title deeds transferred using a forged power of attorney can be annulled through this lawsuit.
