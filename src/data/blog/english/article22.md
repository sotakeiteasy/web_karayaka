The idea of owning a home under the Turkish sun naturally raises the question of long-term residence prospects in the country. Buying property indeed becomes a key factor for obtaining a residence permit (ikamet), opening the way to a comfortable life on the Mediterranean coast. The process has its nuances, and understanding them in advance helps to avoid common difficulties.

## Grounds for stay: property rights and residence permits

Owning a residential property in Turkey is one of the strongest grounds for applying for a short-term residence permit. The purchase itself does not grant residency automatically, but it makes the process much easier, since it proves the applicant’s close connection with the country and solves the housing issue. It is important to note that the property must be residential and suitable for habitation, confirmed by the “iṡat” document (occupancy permit). This document is mandatory for property owners applying for residence. Applications are processed at the Migration Directorate (Göç İdaresi), which considers each case individually.

## Application process: from documents to approval

Obtaining a residence permit based on property ownership requires careful preparation and step-by-step actions. It all begins with collecting the required set of documents. After that, an appointment is booked through the official portal of the Migration Directorate. The application itself is submitted in person at the migration office of the province where the property is located.

The main documents required include:

- a valid foreign passport with a notarized translation;
- a completed residence permit application form;
- the original and a copy of the title deed (tapu), with proof that the property has an “iṡat”;
- valid health insurance for Turkey;
- proof of sufficient financial means for the requested residence period;
- biometric photos in the required format.

After submitting the application package, the applicant receives confirmation that the application is under review. The final decision and the residence permit itself, issued as a plastic card, are provided once all data have been verified.

## Long-term prospects and key limitations

A residence permit based on property is generally issued for one or two years, with the possibility of renewal. Continuous renewals for eight years establish grounds for applying for a permanent residence permit. However, it is crucial to understand the distinction between residency and citizenship. Buying property alone does not automatically lead to a Turkish passport. For that, there is a separate Citizenship by Investment program, which requires stricter financial conditions, such as purchasing property of a statutory minimum value.

A well-prepared application process for a residence permit based on property purchase lays the foundation for a secure life in Turkey. Careful attention to requirements and accurate document handling help minimize risks.
