Purchasing housing in a building under construction is a strategy that can bring significant gains or result in serious financial losses. The Turkish new-build market actively offers lots at early construction stages, attracting buyers with enticing prices. However, such investments require a balanced approach and an understanding of all aspects of the transaction.

## Factors of attractiveness of early market entry

Buying property at the foundation pit stage opens several prospects. The main motivator is the price, which at the start of sales can be 15–30% lower than the market value at the time of delivery. This approach makes it possible to acquire a lot in a promising location with potential for subsequent capitalization. Investors also gain the opportunity to choose the most liquid layouts — with sea views, on the first lines. Some developers offer flexible phased payment plans that distribute the financial load over the entire construction period.

## Risk architecture when dealing with unfinished properties

Despite potential benefits, this segment comes with serious risks. The main one is developer dishonesty or financial insolvency, which can lead to project freezing or bankruptcy. Project implementation often comes with deviations from the original plan: changes in finishes, reduced material quality, and adjustments to the residential complex’s infrastructure. Significant delays in delivery are common, disrupting buyers’ personal or investment plans. The absence of a key document — the occupancy permit (Iskan) — makes the property legally unsuitable for habitation and registration of ownership.

## Safe investment strategy in new builds

Potential threats can be minimized through a comprehensive approach to selecting a property. Start with a thorough check of the developer’s reputation and portfolio: review the history of completed projects, owner feedback, and the company’s financial indicators. The purchase agreement must be carefully analyzed by a lawyer specializing in Turkish law. The contract should clearly specify:

- Financial guarantees and refund mechanisms.
- Final delivery deadlines with specified penalties.
- Detailed descriptions of finishes, materials, and layout solutions.

Buying property at the foundation pit stage resembles a strategic game with high stakes. The balance between attractive pricing and legal risks is achieved through expert analysis and professional support. Reducing uncertainty and executing a safe transaction is facilitated by specialists with deep knowledge of the local market, such as the experts at [karayaka.ru](https://karayaka.ru/).
