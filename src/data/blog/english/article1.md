## 1. Foreigners Buying Real Estate in Turkey

### Legal Basis

Russian citizens are allowed to purchase property in Turkey under Article 35 of the Turkish Land Registry Law No. 2644. However, the following restrictions apply:

- Purchasing real estate in military or security zones is strictly prohibited.
- A foreign individual may purchase up to 30 hectares of property in total across Turkey.
- Foreign ownership in any district cannot exceed 10% of the total area designated by local municipalities.

## 2. Step-by-Step Buying Process

### Step 1: Choosing the Right Property

Russian buyers should select a property that suits their needs. This can be done through real estate agencies or by contacting owners directly.

Key considerations include:

- Development potential of the region
- Property prices and investment returns
- Presence of liens or encumbrances on the title
- Taxes and additional costs

### Step 2: Legal and Title Deed Check

Before proceeding, the following should be verified at the Land Registry Office:

- Is the seller the legal owner of the property?
- Are there any mortgages, seizures, or restrictions on the title?
- What is the zoning and occupancy permit status of the property? (Check with the local municipality.)

You can access this information via the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre, municipalities, and the e-Government system.

Russian citizens must prepare the following documents:

- Passport (with notarized Turkish translation)
