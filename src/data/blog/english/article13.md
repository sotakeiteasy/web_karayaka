## Citizenship Strategy: How the Program Works and Its Conditions

The Turkish citizenship by investment program has been in effect since 2017 and has proven its effectiveness. The main route is purchasing real estate for a specified amount with ownership fixed for at least three years. The minimum threshold for participation is $400,000. It is allowed to buy one or several properties as long as the total amount is met.

Citizenship is granted not only to the main investor but also to immediate family members â€” spouse and children under 18. The process takes from 3 to 6 months, and the passport is issued on the same grounds as for citizens by birth.

An important requirement is the absence of a mortgage and the obligation not to sell the property within three years. These conditions are recorded in the _tapu_ (title deed), which eliminates the risk of losing citizenship rights in the future. The investment process includes:

- legal due diligence of the property;
- opening an account in a Turkish bank;
- registration at the Land Registry with a note prohibiting sale;
- submission of citizenship documents through the immigration office and Ministry of Interior.

## Property Selection: From New Developments to Commercial Properties

The investment approach requires careful analysis of the prospective property. Not all real estate qualifies for the program. A mandatory condition is that the property must be officially registered, have a full set of documents, and permission to be sold to foreign citizens.

The most common option is buying apartments in major cities or resort areas with high price growth potential. In Istanbul and Antalya, demand focuses on new residential complexes with modern infrastructure. In Alanya, demand is for apartments in areas with high tourist flow.

Some investors consider commercial real estate: office spaces, shops, hotels. This format allows not only to meet program requirements but also to receive regular income.

It is also allowed to purchase properties under construction, provided the contract is notarized and entered into the state registry. This expands investor opportunities, giving a chance to enter a project at an early stage and save money.

## Advantages of the Turkish Passport and Process Support

The Turkish passport opens a wide range of opportunities. It provides visa-free access to more than 110 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Argentina, and Singapore, as well as access to healthcare, education, business rights, and land purchase without restrictions.

A Turkish citizen gains full political and social rights, including the ability to open accounts in any bank in the country, obtain loans, work without permits, and participate in tenders. Additionally, Turkey recognizes dual citizenship, allowing holders to keep their original passports.

The application process requires knowledge of local laws, language, tax, and cadastral regulations. Transaction security, legal cleanliness of the property, and compliance with all investment program conditions are crucial.
