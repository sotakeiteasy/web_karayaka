## Landlord Rights and Obligations

### 1. Landlord Rights

#### 1.1 Right to Receive Rent on Time

A landlord has the right to demand full and timely rent payments in accordance with the rental agreement. If the tenant delays payment:

- The landlord can issue a formal notice via a notary requesting payment.
- If the rent is still unpaid, legal enforcement proceedings may be initiated.
- If the tenant is late for two or more rental periods, an eviction lawsuit may be filed.

#### 1.2 Right to Request a Security Deposit

Landlords may request a deposit equal to 1 to 3 months' rent. The deposit:

- Must be refunded in full if the tenant returns the property without damage.
- Can be held in a bank account and used upon the tenant's departure if needed.

#### 1.3 Right to Evict the Tenant

A landlord may seek to evict a tenant in the following situations:

- Non-payment of rent: A formal notice is sent, and if unpaid, eviction proceedings may follow.
- Eviction commitment: If the tenant has signed a written commitment to vacate, they can be evicted on the agreed date.
- Personal or family need: If the landlord or a first-degree relative needs the property, they may request eviction with proof of necessity.
- Major renovation or reconstruction: The tenant can be evicted if the property requires significant repairs or rebuilding.

#### 1.4 Right to Increase Rent

As of 2025, rental increases are limited to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate. A landlord:

- Can increase the rent upon annual contract renewal, not exceeding the CPI rate.
- Any increase above CPI without tenant agreement can be deemed invalid by the courts.
