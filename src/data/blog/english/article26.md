Selling real estate in Turkey is a structured process, the success of which depends on understanding legal norms and market mechanisms. Proper preparation allows completing the transaction efficiently, minimizing tax liabilities and avoiding common mistakes.

## Preparation for sale and legal aspects

The first step is assessing the market value of the property, taking into account location, condition, infrastructure, and current market conditions. Checking legal clarity is mandatory: absence of encumbrances (mortgages, easements), availability of a valid occupancy permit (Iskan), and a clean utility balance increase buyer trust. Documents required for potential buyers include:

- Title deed (Tapu).
- Identification document with official translation.
- Tax number (Vergi Numarası).
- Valuation report from a licensed expert (basis for tax calculation).

## Financial aspects and finding a buyer

The main financial aspect is the capital gains tax (gelir vergisi). Its amount depends on the period of ownership: if the property is sold within 5 years from the purchase date, tax is levied on the difference between the purchase and sale prices. The rate varies from 15% to 40%, according to a progressive scale. Buyers are sought through real estate agencies, professional online platforms, and social networks. Quality photo and video presentations, as well as being open to viewings, significantly speed up the process.

## Transaction procedure and strategic missteps

The main transaction takes place at the Land Registry Office (Tapu Dairesi). Presence of both parties or their officially authorized representatives with notarized powers of attorney is required. Funds are usually transferred to the seller’s bank account before or during signing, documented with a receipt. A common mistake is overpricing, which leads to the property stagnating on the market. Incorrect tax calculations are also frequent, often resulting in fines. Saving on professional translators or lawyers during preparation creates risks of legal conflicts.

A successful sale requires a comprehensive approach combining an accurate pricing strategy, flawless legal preparation, and effective marketing. Risks can be minimized, and transparency ensured at all stages, through cooperation with experts who have deep knowledge of local specifics.
