## 1. Rental Agreement and Duration

### Contract Duration and Renewal

- Residential and commercial lease agreements are typically made for a period of one year.
- Regardless of whether the agreement is for one year or a shorter term, if the tenant does not vacate the property and the landlord does not request eviction for a valid legal reason, the contract is automatically renewed under the same conditions for another year.
- The landlord can only evict the tenant without legal cause after 10 years of automatic renewals.

For example, if a tenant has a 6-month lease and does not inform the landlord about vacating, the contract will be automatically extended for another one year (with only a rental increase based on the CPI rate).

### No Need for a New Agreement

- Once the lease expires, it is not necessary to sign a new contract. The existing contract continues under the same conditions.
- If the landlord insists on signing a new agreement and the tenant refuses, the original contract remains valid.
- If the tenant does not notify the landlord at least 15 days before the end of the contract that they will vacate, the lease will automatically extend for another year.

## 2. Rental Price Increases

### Residential Leases

- A temporary cap on rent increases at 25% ended on July 1, 2024.
- As of 2025, rental increases are determined by CPI (Consumer Price Index) rates again.
- For example, the CPI rate for January 2025 was announced as 58.51%. Accordingly, landlords may increase the rent by up to 58.51%.

### Commercial Leases

- For commercial properties, rental increases are also based on CPI rates as of 2025.

## 3. Maintenance Fees and Other Expenses

### Maintenance Fees (Aidat)

- These are typically paid by the tenant.
- However, major expenses like capital improvements or equipment renewal are the responsibility of the property owner.
- The tenant must regularly pay the maintenance fees determined by the building management.

## 4. Renovations and Repairs

### Renovations by the Tenant

- Tenants may not make major renovations without the landlord's written consent.
- Minor maintenance and repairs are the tenant's responsibility. For instance, changing a faucet or repainting the walls can be done by the tenant.

### Repairs by the Landlord

- The landlord is responsible for major repairs required to keep the property in a habitable condition.
- The tenant must notify the landlord and request the necessary repairs to be made.

## 5. Tenant Rights if the Property is Sold

### New Owner's Rights

- If the landlord sells the property, the new owner is bound by the existing lease agreement.
- However, if the new owner intends to use the property for personal needs, they may file an eviction lawsuit within 6 months.

### Tenant's Rights

- If the tenant is asked to vacate due to the new owner's personal use, they may defend themselves using legal rights and, if applicable, request compensation.
- The eligibility and amount of compensation vary depending on the specific case.

## Conclusion

As of 2025, tenant rights and obligations in Turkey are clearly defined by current legal regulations.

- Tenants cannot be evicted without a valid legal reason during the lease period, cannot face rental increases beyond the legal limit, and may continue living in the property for a certain period even if it is sold.
- Understanding these rights and obligations is crucial for both tenants and landlords.
