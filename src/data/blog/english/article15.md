## Geography of Profitability: Which Cities Deliver the Best Results

The rental market in Turkey is divided into two main categories: short-term tourist rentals and long-term urban rentals. Each format has its own specifics, seasonality, and income level. To ensure stable returns, it is important to understand in which regions and under what conditions real estate generates maximum profit.

The most predictable income comes from short-term rentals in resort cities — Alanya, Antalya, Fethiye, Kemer. During the season, properties rent out 10 to 20 days per month, with rental prices ranging from 50 to 150 euros per day depending on the type of property, location, and level of amenities. The main flow of tenants are tourists from Europe, the CIS, and the Persian Gulf countries.

In large cities — Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa — there is higher demand for long-term rentals. These are often rented by students, young professionals, and foreign employees of international companies. The monthly income is lower, but there is no seasonal drop. In prestigious districts of Istanbul, two-room apartments rent for 700–1000 euros per month with relatively low competition in the premium segment.

A special category includes areas with growth potential — new developments in the suburbs of metropolises and active development of transport infrastructure. Prices are currently low, but both rental prices and property values are expected to rise in the coming years.

## Expenses Affecting Net Profit

To understand how much rental income truly brings, it is important to consider associated expenses, without which the profitability calculation will be distorted. The main cost items are divided into mandatory and variable.

**Mandatory:**

- rental income tax (rate depends on the type of contract and residency status);
- annual property tax;
- utility payments when the property is vacant;
- maintenance fees (if the property is in a residential complex with infrastructure).

**Variable:**

- property management company commission (on average 20–30% of rental income);
- advertising and promotion on platforms (Airbnb, Booking, local aggregators);
- minor repairs, furniture updates, appliance replacement;
- liability insurance for the landlord.

Profit reduction most often occurs due to incorrect calculation of seasonal occupancy. For example, in Alanya, from October to April, there are few tourists, and short-term rentals bring only 10–20% of annual income. A solution may be a hybrid model: short-term rentals during the season and long-term rentals off-season.

## How to Increase Profitability: Practical Tips and Strategies

You can maximize rental income by carefully selecting the property and using an effective management model. First — choose a property type with stable demand. For example, studios and one-bedroom apartments in city centers, seaside apartments with a private kitchen and terrace, or properties with hotel infrastructure.

Second — present the property properly to tenants. Examples of increasing income:

- high-quality photo and video presentation;
- booking automation through popular platforms;
- offering additional services: transfers, cleaning, car rental.

For investors focused on stable income, calculating payback period is important. On average, the payback period for rental investments in Turkey is 8 to 12 years. In popular areas with high-quality management, it can be faster.
