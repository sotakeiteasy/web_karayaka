## Introduction

Buying real estate in Turkey grants foreign nationals the right to apply for a short-term residence permit. This option is especially favored by investors, retirees, and families who wish to live in Turkey either permanently or seasonally. As of 2025, updated rules apply and should be carefully considered before making a purchase.

## Key Requirements

- **Property value must be at least USD 200,000** (or equivalent in TRY).
- The property must be **residential, completed**, and have a **registered title deed (Kat Mülkiyeti)**.
- The property must be located in a **district open to foreign residence permit applications** — some areas are restricted due to population density (e.g., parts of Antalya or Istanbul).

## Step-by-Step Process

**1. Obtain Tax ID & Open Bank Account**  
Foreign buyers must first get a **Turkish Tax Number (Vergi Numarası)** and open a **Turkish bank account**.

**2. Purchase the Property**  
Sign the **purchase agreement**, complete the **title deed registration (Tapu)**, and pay via **bank transfer**.

**3. Apply Online for Residence Permit**  
Submit an application via **[e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr](https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr)**. Select an appointment date with the **local Directorate of Migration Management**.

**4. Prepare Documents**

- Passport + notarized Turkish translation
- Copy of title deed
- Address registration document
- Health insurance valid in Turkey
- 4 biometric photos
- Proof of financial means (e.g., bank statement or income)

**5. Attend Interview & Receive Permit**  
After document submission, the applicant receives a **1-year residence card**, which can be renewed annually as long as ownership is maintained.

## Additional Notes

- **Spouse and children under 18** can apply as dependents.
- **Co-ownership** is allowed among immediate family members.
- **Properties under construction or bought via companies do not qualify**.
- An **SPK-approved valuation report** is required to prove the property's value meets the legal threshold.

## Conclusion

Real estate purchase remains a reliable and legal way to live in Turkey while also investing in one of the region’s most dynamic property markets. With professional legal guidance, the process is smooth, transparent, and secure.
