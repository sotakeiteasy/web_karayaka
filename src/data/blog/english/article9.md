## Requirements and Step-by-Step Process

**1. Minimum Investment Requirement**  
The applicant must purchase one or more real estate properties worth at least **USD 400,000**. These may be under construction or completed.

**2. Property Valuation and Payment**  
A valuation report from a licensed SPK-approved appraiser must be obtained.  
Payment must be made via Turkish banks, and a **Currency Purchase Certificate (DAB)** must be issued as proof of foreign currency exchange.

**3. Title Deed Transfer & Restriction**  
After the purchase, a “**not to be sold for 3 years**” annotation is registered on the title deed (Tapu). This restriction is a mandatory condition of the citizenship program.

**4. Certificate of Eligibility**  
An application is submitted to the **Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change**, which issues a certificate confirming the investment meets legal criteria.

**5. Residence Permit Application**  
The investor then applies for a **short-term residence permit** based on property ownership and the eligibility certificate.

**6. Citizenship Application**  
Finally, all documents are submitted to the **General Directorate of Population and Citizenship Affairs**. Processing time is typically **2 to 6 months**.

- Eligible properties include **residential, commercial, or land**.
- **Multiple properties** may be combined to meet the **USD 400,000** threshold.

## Conclusion
