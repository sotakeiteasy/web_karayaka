## 1. What is a Rent Determination Lawsuit?

A rent determination lawsuit is filed to assess whether the current rental price is in line with market conditions.

- A tenant may file the case if they believe the rent they pay is significantly above market value.
- A landlord may file the case if they believe the rent is too low compared to current market conditions.

## 2. Who Can File a Rent Determination Lawsuit?

- Tenants: May request a reduction in rent if they believe the current amount is excessively high.
- Landlords: May request an increase if the rent is too low based on market rates.
- Co-owners: In the case of joint ownership, each owner may request a determination for their share of the rent.

## 3. Which Court Handles Rent Determination Lawsuits?

- These lawsuits are generally filed at the Civil Court of Peace located in the district where the rented property is situated.
- If the parties are commercial entities (companies or public institutions), the lawsuit may also be filed in the court specified in the lease agreement.

## 4. When Can a Rent Determination Lawsuit Be Filed?

- If the parties cannot agree on the annual rent increase, the lawsuit must be filed at least 30 days before the start of the new rental year.
- For rental agreements that have been in place for five years or longer, either party may apply to have the rent reassessed.

The court takes into account factors such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), comparable rental prices, and the condition of the property to determine a fair rent.

## 5. When Does the Court's Decision Take Effect?

- If the lawsuit is filed at least 30 days before the new rental period, the new rent amount applies from the beginning of that rental year.
- If it is filed later, the new rental amount is effective from the date of the court's decision.

## 6. Criteria Considered in Rent Determination

When determining a new rent, the court evaluates:

- CPI (12-month average inflation rate)
- The location, condition, and features of the rented property
- Comparable rental prices in similar areas
- Whether the tenant has lived in the property for a long time (a long-term tenant may be eligible for a reduction)

## 7. Outcome and Implementation of the Lawsuit

- The court's decision cannot be enforced until it becomes finalized.
- Once finalized, the tenant is legally required to pay the newly determined rent.
- If the parties cannot agree on the new rent, the court's ruling will be enforced by law.

## 8. Cost of a Rent Determination Lawsuit

- A court fee must be paid to file the case. This fee is calculated based on the difference between the current and the newly proposed rent.
- The winning party may also request attorney fees and court expenses to be paid by the losing party.

## Conclusion

A rent determination lawsuit is an important legal tool for both landlords and tenants in Turkey.

- If the rent increase cannot be agreed upon or if either party believes the current rent is not aligned with market conditions, a lawsuit may be filed.
- However, timing and proper filing are critical. If the lawsuit is not initiated before the new rental year begins, the new rent may only be applicable for the following year.

In Turkey, it is highly recommended that both tenants and landlords seek professional legal assistance to navigate rental disputes efficiently.
