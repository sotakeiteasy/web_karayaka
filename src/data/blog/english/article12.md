## The Turkish Market Through the Eyes of an Investor: From Resort Locations to Business Centers

The Turkish real estate market offers dozens of destinations with varying growth dynamics, prices, and potential returns. Before making a decision, it is worth considering not only popular regions but also how they align with your goals — rental business, relocation, capital preservation, or citizenship.

Antalya has long been considered the flagship of Mediterranean real estate. The city consistently ranks among the top in the number of transactions involving foreign buyers. Infrastructure, tourist flow, an international airport, and stable rental demand make it attractive for investment. At the same time, districts vary significantly in price. Konyaaltı and Lara are traditionally more expensive and oriented towards foreigners, while new neighborhoods to the east offer opportunities for early-stage purchases.

Alanya is smaller than Antalya but often wins on price. Districts like Mahmutlar, Oba, and Kestel are actively developing with modern complexes featuring pools and fitness centers, and the price per square meter remains affordable. High occupancy during the season and developed infrastructure make Alanya convenient both for living and short-term rentals.

## Istanbul: A Metropolis with Different Buying Scenarios

The only city in Turkey located simultaneously in Asia and Europe, Istanbul is a center of business activity, finance, and education. It is chosen not for beaches but for infrastructure, career opportunities, international schools for children, and medical clinics.

The real estate market here is less seasonal and more stable. Investors focus on new buildings with ready documents and the possibility of obtaining citizenship. Popular locations include:

- Başakşehir and Beylikdüzü — developing districts with good transport accessibility;
- Kadıköy and Üsküdar — prestigious Asian side neighborhoods with a high standard of living;
- Şişli and Beşiktaş — European side with business activity.

Istanbul has high rental demand, especially near universities, business districts, and metro stations. Returns are higher, but the market entry threshold is noticeably higher compared to southern resorts.

## Alternatives to the Giants: Fethiye, Izmir, and Bodrum as New Centers of Attraction

Demand for housing outside the classic destinations is growing. This is largely due to rising prices in Antalya and Istanbul, as well as buyers’ desire to find a quieter place to live or vacation.

Fethiye is a compact city with picturesque nature and clear waters, oriented towards those who appreciate tranquility. There are few high-rise buildings; villas and low-rise complexes prevail. It is an excellent location to buy a seaside home without the bustle of a metropolis.

Bodrum is a premium-class resort. Luxury real estate, yachts, five-star hotels, and proximity to the Greek islands make it attractive to wealthy buyers. Prices are above the national average, but the housing format meets the expectations of a demanding audience.

Izmir is Turkey’s third-largest city by population. A developed economy, universities, a port, and cultural life create steady demand. It is closer to a European lifestyle, and the surroundings of Izmir feature picturesque villages and beaches comparable to the Aegean coast of Greece.

The karayaka.ru website helps to navigate these locations, select reliable properties, assess prospects, and complete transactions without risks.
